 1. in fhir, when check if something ref in other field is contained in Contained section, using ResourceReference.IsContainedReferece and our extension method GetContainerResouce.. to get the contained ref.

ResourceReference is very useful

2, every project has a ioc installer class, it can create its own intances and it need to check if the global instance has been resolved 
container.Kernel.HasComponent(typeof(IAppConfig)))

if not it should create it.  container.Register(
					Component.For<IAppConfig>().ImplementedBy<AppConfig>());

3. check the interExcption can find the internal position that throws the exception

serializer = new XmlSerializer(typeof(BulkBilleClaimingRequest));


can not handle any interface.....shit....
