1. Specification pattern 
-- Looking up data in the database. That is finding records that match the specification we have in hand.

-- Validating objects in the memory. In other words, checking that an object we retrieved or created fits the spec.

-- Creating a new instance that matches the criteria. This is useful in scenarios where you don’t care about the actual content of the instances, but still need it to have certain attributes.

2. DRY --  Don’t Repeat Yourself -- such as check something same in the differnet place
