1. App.config
App.Debug.config....App.Release.config

2. When try to save/load/update fhir resource, we needt to create a APIM portal for it with /fhir/ in the url.
APIM will be responsible to pass the request to the real spart API. The SparkFhirAdaptor is only thin to pass the request to APIM. 

the APIM operation should have Create/Update/Get/Delete/Get objects
