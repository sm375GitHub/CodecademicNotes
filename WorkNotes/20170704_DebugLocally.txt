1. after deploy webjob processors, it complains cannot find webconfig. It is because the exe is deploied into the wrong webjob.

TelemetryConfiguration.Active.InstrumentationKey = CloudConfigurationManager.GetSetting("appInsightsInstrumentationKey");

So need to check the exe file under each webjob before deploying it.

2. how validation can return error to postman????

3. FluentValidation need to add WithMessage and need Unit Test

4. when using ajax, need to passing the logic in the success section . because ajax is asyn so it can not return anyting back in time. 

5. in Tenantapi overview: the url is the "tenantApiUri" used in the environment

6, debug controller, run apiHost , and then run the controller with the url. when run controller, add controller's webconfig into apiHost's webconfig

7. debug processor. using postman feed the queue, and stop azure webjob. then run processor locally to using the message in azure queue

need to copy queueName listened into App.config, and need to copy other important data into app.config file.
