2.documentation to replace emails 

3. when creating the base class which has a field with an interface IA1, if the children classes contains different concretaed class of IA1. Then we can define the base class as a generic class <T> where T: IA1

4. Create generic type instance, can add condition as    where T : IComparable, new()
