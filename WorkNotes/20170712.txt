1. need to release tools, dev and spart together. otherwise one part failed can cause the whole testing failing
2. when deploy to diffrent environment, need to assign the claim permission between subscriptions.
   the resouce created by one tenant can not be access by another defaultly. in Easyclaim. we created claim by a subscription passed by request message(such as postman), and consume it with the Payment tenant created by simon as a sepcial claim consumor. In this case we need to set permission between the postman tannant with the payment tenant.
