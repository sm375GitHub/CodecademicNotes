1. in the factory, pass type in and using typeof(GeneralClass<>).MakeGenericType(Type1) ===> it create type of GeneralClass<Type1>. Then use it to resolve in IOC to create concrete instance of classes defined. 

All concrete instances are inherited from IResourceSync interface.... so the factory is an abstract factory, it is passed in to class as constuctor parameter and return an interface
