1. using polymorphism to handle switch/case. Common interface + factory

-- Martin Fowler's "Refactoring"

-- Strategy Pattern 
-- Clean code

2. To pass the type into the generic type of the function we can use reflection rather than switch/case...

3. Task<string> ... Task.Run(()=>obj);

4. CyclomaticComplexity: M=E-N+2P
  E-- edges   N-- nodes of the graph  p the number of connected components

5. create less class to matain. Not use too much protected virtual functions in the default function
6. any factory class should in the factory folder
