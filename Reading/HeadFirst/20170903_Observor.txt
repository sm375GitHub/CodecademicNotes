1. subject/observers
object subscribes to the subject
one to many relationship

Subject: register/remove/notify Observer
observer: Update()

Loop coupling:
So the only thing subject knows about observers is they implemented same interface and have same update function.

*** strive for loosely coupled designs between objs

-- passing parameters in Update() function.

-- Observer get the subject from such as constructor paramters. And then using the registerObserver function in the subject to subscript itself in the subscripts.
