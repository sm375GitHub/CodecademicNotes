1. Compile-time and runtime constants
 - runtime constants is slower/correct programe than compile-time constant
 - Compile-time is faster but far less flexible. Only used for performance is critical and never change value

2. runtime constants : static readonly
   Compile constants : const  -- can be declared inside method

3. in IL, the compile constant is replaced by the value directly, while runtime constant are evaluated only during the runtime, IL can not know the value.

4.Compile constant can only use for primitive type (built-in int, float, enum or string) for initializing, in order to be replaced in IL.

runtime constants can be any type
5, updating the value of a public constant should be viewed as an interface change, should recompile all code that references that constant. 

6, persistent values taht mark specific versions hould be compile-time constants.they never change.
