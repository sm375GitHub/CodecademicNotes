First of all, property is a METHOD.....it can used as a method(implement differnt logic inside)

1. property can be used by interface
2. using reflection to find a named property in a type/ but it can not find a public memeber
3. can add some simple validation( such as null check) in the public property, e.g throw exception...
4. We should take the advantage of Property being method, not only use it as a simple public data member.

5. property can be virtual

6. public int this[int index]/[string]/[int, string].....
